I am currently a Master's student in the ECE department at the University of Tehran. I am actively engaged in research within the Machine Learning and Computational Modeling Lab, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FTcata0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Babak Nadjar Araabi</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Lc1LZWIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh</a>, where my Master's thesis focuses on developing causal discovery methods to extract brain-effective connectomes. Moreover, I am working on <a>identifiablity</a> and <a>Causal representation learning</a> to build more robust models for domain generalization.
